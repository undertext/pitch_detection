<p>In order to work with sound we need to capture it.<br/>Sound is a vibration and can be represented as a sinusoid wave.<br/><img src="img/sound_wave.jpg" alt="sound wave" title="Sound wave" /></p>
<p>The main characteristics of a sound wave are:<br/> - Amplitude. The bigger amplitude we have the louder sound we hear.<br/> - Frequency. The higher frequency the higher pitch we hear.</p>
<p>So how is sound captured?<br/>The real microphone is capturing the value of amplitude every 1/44100 sec (44100 is just an example number), and we<br/>get something like this.<br/><img src="img/digital_wave.png" alt="digital wave" title="Digital wave" /><br/>Why we used 1/44100 sec in the example? "1/44100" is a <a href="#">Sample Rate</a>.<br/>The fact that we capture sound every 1/44100 sec<br/>due to <a href="#">Nyquist theorem</a><br/>means that we can capture sound in 0Hz - 22500Hz diapasone (22500 = 44100/2).<br/>And 22500Hz - is the highest pitch that human can hear, so we do not need to capture sound more frequentnly then 44100 Hz.<br/>44100 Hz - is a standard sample rate in music staff.</p>
